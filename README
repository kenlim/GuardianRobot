This is the code that runs the Guardian Robot. There are 2 folders here:

1. GuardianRobotArduinoController
This is the code that will be uploaded to the Arduino board. This controls the actual servos and switches. 

2. GuardianRobotTwitterPollingService
This is the code that runs on your computer and actually polls Twitter. It sends emotive directions to the robot via USB.
